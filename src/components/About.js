                In the future, I would like to obtain a post-graduate degree in
                computer science because I love research and the idea of
                discovery. I also enjoy{" "}
                <span style={highlightStyle}> building applications </span>{" "}
                (especially at hackathons). I am not completely sure what my
                future will look like, whether I will continue in academia or go
                straight into the industry, but I hope that my future is bright!

                Before I turn 30, I would like to{" "}
                <span style={highlightStyle}>backpack around China</span>. My
                trip there this past summer (2025) was eye opening. I realized I
                don't really understand anything about people, so by putting
                myself in an environment where I'm forced to interact in a
                language I am not 100% familiar with, I hope to learn more about
                myself and about what the world is truly like. Additionally, I
                hope to learn to appreciate nature more. Nature is a gift from
                earth, so I would like to genuinely explore it at least once
                before I am physically unable to anymore.
