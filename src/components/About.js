                Hi, I'm James (Jimmy) Zhou â€” a computer science student at the University of Maryland. I'm currently interested in <span style={highlightStyle}>software development</span> and <span style={highlightStyle}>machine learning research</span>.

                I enjoy listening to music, <span style={highlightStyle}>science-based lifting</span>, cooking (and eating), reading, and watching anime. I also enjoy posting on my <span style={highlightStyle}>blog</span>!

                In the future, I would like to obtain a <span style={highlightStyle}>post-graduate degree</span> in computer science or machine learning. I love research and the idea of discovery, so I'm pretty sure I want to continue in academia. However, I also enjoy <span style={highlightStyle}>building applications</span> (especially at hackathons), so I am not 100% sure about what I want to happen in my future. <br />
                <br />
                Before I turn 30, I would like to <span style={highlightStyle}>backpack around eastern Europe</span> and, hopefully, climb as many mountains as I can. Nature in general is a gift from Earth, so I would like to genuinely explore it at least once before I am physically unable to.

                  I have two pets: a cat (Star) and a dog (Sky). I love Star SO MUCH, but Sky is chunky and a little smelly so I like him a little less.

                  Star is around 6 years old, and Sky is 4 years old. I'm not sure what breed Star is because we adopted him from a shelter, but Sky is a <span style={highlightStyle}>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</span>.
